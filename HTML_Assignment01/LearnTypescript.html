      JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand
      what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript. In JavaScript,
      function parameters and variables don't have any information! So
      developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the
      implementation.
      <b
        >TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around
        within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types
        don't match. For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a
        string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript will not.</b

      A common way to use TypeScript is to use the official TypeScript compiler,
      which transpiles TypeScript code into JavaScript. The next section shows
      how to get the compiler setup for a local project. <i>Some popular code
        editors, such as Visual Studio Code, have built-in TypeScript support and
        can show errors as you write code!</i>
