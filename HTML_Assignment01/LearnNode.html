    <p>
      Node (or more formally Node.js) is an open-source, cross-platform runtime
      environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side
      tools and applications in JavaScript. The runtime is intended for use
      outside of a browser context (i.e. running directly on a computer or
      server OS). As such, the environment omits browser-specific JavaScript
      APIs and adds support for more traditional OS APIs including HTTP and file

        scalability in web applications and is a good solution for many common
        web-development problems (e.g. real-time web applications).</b

      <i>Code is written in "plain old JavaScript", which means that less time is
        spent dealing with "context shift" between languages when you're writing
        both client-side and server-side code.</i>
